Pin and Needle is a full-stack Pinterest clone. Like Pinterest you can upload photos as pins, save the pin to a board, and explore pins from other users. Each pin is comprised of a photo, which is stored on AWS, and optional link, title and description. Users create boards, and can save their own pins, as well as other users' pins to their boards. Pin and Needle is the perfect place to find inspiration.
